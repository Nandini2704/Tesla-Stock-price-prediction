# Tesla-Stock-price-prediction
This project predicts Tesla stock prices using linear regression, a machine learning algorithm . We'll feed historical data (Tesla prices, trading volume, etc.) into the model. It will find a straight line trend that best fits the data. We'll use this line to estimate future Tesla prices.
